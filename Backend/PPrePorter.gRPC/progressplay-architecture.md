# ProgressPlay Reporting Platform - Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The new reporting platform will follow a modern, scalable architecture:

![Architecture Diagram](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*a-FjiJcvkvwHDc2Vl8uoGQ.jpeg)

### Core Components

1. **Database Layer**: Leveraging existing MS SQL database with new reporting views
2. **API Layer**: RESTful services implemented in C# with ASP.NET Core
3. **Frontend**: React application with component-based architecture
4. **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based permissions
5. **Caching Layer**: Redis for performance optimization
6. **Export Services**: Dedicated services for CSV/Excel/PDF exports

## Database Approach

### New Views and Stored Procedures

To optimize reporting performance while maintaining the existing schema:

1. Create denormalized reporting views for each major report type
2. Implement efficient stored procedures for complex calculations
3. Add indexing strategies optimized for reporting queries
4. Implement partitioning for large historical tables

Example of a new reporting view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vw_PlayerSummaryReport]
AS
SELECT 
    p.PlayerID,
    p.Alias,
    p.FirstName,
    p.LastName,
    p.Email,
    p.Country,
    p.Currency,
    p.RegisteredDate,
    p.FirstDepositDate,
    p.LastDepositDate,
    p.TotalDeposits,
    p.TotalWithdrawals,
    p.TotalBetsCasino,
    p.TotalBetsSport,
    p.TotalBetsLive,
    p.TotalBetsBingo,
    p.Wagered,
    p.RevenueEUR,
    p.CasinoID,
    wl.LabelName AS WhiteLabel,
    COALESCE(p.AffiliateID, '') AS AffiliateID,
    COALESCE(p.DynamicParameter, '') AS Tracker
FROM 
    common.tbl_Daily_actions_players p
LEFT JOIN 
    common.tbl_White_labels wl ON p.CasinoID = wl.LabelID
```

## Backend Architecture

### API Structure

The backend will be organized in layers:

1. **Controllers**: Route API requests
2. **Services**: Implement business logic
3. **Repositories**: Handle data access
4. **Models**: Define data structures
5. **Filters**: Implement cross-cutting concerns

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Query Builder**: Allow flexible report generation based on user parameters
2. **Report Templates**: Pre-built and custom report definitions
3. **Authorization Middleware**: Enforce role-based access controls
4. **Caching Strategy**: Optimize performance for common queries
5. **Background Processing**: Handle long-running report generation

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

The React application will follow a modular structure:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Layout (Header, Sidebar, Content)
   - Authentication
   - Navigation
   - User Preferences

2. **Report Components**:
   - Report Container
   - Filter Panel
   - Data Grid/Table
   - Visualization Components (Charts, Graphs)
   - Export Options

3. **Admin Components**:
   - User Management
   - Report Template Management
   - System Configuration

### State Management

We'll use Redux for state management, with slices for:

1. **Authentication**: User identity and permissions
2. **Reports**: Active report definitions and parameters
3. **Data**: Report results and loading states
4. **UI**: Theme, layout, and user preferences

## Role-Based Access Control

The system will implement a comprehensive RBAC model:

1. **Admin**:
   - Full access to all reports and data
   - User management capabilities
   - System configuration access

2. **Partner**:
   - Access restricted to their whitelabels
   - Filtered data in all reports
   - Limited admin capabilities

3. **Subpartner**:
   - Access to single whitelabel with specific tracker
   - Highly filtered data views
   - Limited report customization

## Report Customization Framework

Users will be able to customize reports through:

1. **Filter Management**: Save and load filter configurations
2. **Column Selection**: Choose which columns to display
3. **Grouping Options**: Aggregate data by different dimensions
4. **Visualization Preferences**: Select chart types and options
5. **Scheduled Reports**: Configure automated report generation

## Performance Optimization

To ensure the system handles large data volumes efficiently:

1. **Query Optimization**: Carefully designed database queries
2. **Pagination**: Load data in chunks
3. **Lazy Loading**: Only load data when needed
4. **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Generate large reports in the background

## Data Export Options

Support for various export formats:

1. **CSV**: For raw data export
2. **Excel**: For formatted reports with calculations
3. **PDF**: For presentation-ready reports
4. **JSON/API**: For integration with other systems

## Deployment Strategy

We recommend a containerized deployment approach:

1. **Docker Containers**: Package application components
2. **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containers for scaling
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing and deployment
4. **Environment Segregation**: Dev, QA, Production separation

## Monitoring and Analytics

Implement comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Application Insights**: Track performance and usage
2. **Error Logging**: Capture and alert on exceptions
3. **User Activity**: Monitor feature usage
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and bottlenecks
