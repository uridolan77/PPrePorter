# Implementation of Report Customization and Scheduling

Let me provide additional implementation details for the report customization and scheduling functionality, which are key features for your ProgressPlay reporting platform.

# ProgressPlay Analytics Platform Implementation Plan

I've provided a comprehensive implementation for modernizing your ProgressPlay reporting system. Let me highlight the key components I've designed:

## Core Architecture

The solution follows a modern, scalable architecture:

1. **Backend (C# ASP.NET Core)**: Provides a RESTful API with efficient data access through optimized database views and stored procedures.

2. **Frontend (React)**: Delivers a responsive, intuitive user interface with rich visualizations and interactive components.

3. **Database (MS SQL Server)**: Leverages your existing schema with new optimized views and strategic indexing for reporting performance.

## Key Features Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control
The system implements three distinct permission levels as requested:
- **Admin**: Full access to all data and functionality
- **Partner**: Access restricted to their whitelabels
- **Subpartner**: Access limited to a single whitelabel with specific tracker filtering

### Dashboard & Visualizations
The dashboard presents critical KPIs and metrics with:
- Daily summary statistics with comparison to previous periods
- Interactive revenue charts for different gaming categories
- Player registration and activity analysis
- Top games performance by revenue
- Recent transaction monitoring

### Advanced Reporting
The reporting system provides:
- Customizable report templates with flexible parameter selection
- Dynamic filtering, grouping, and sorting options
- Save and load functionality for report configurations
- Comprehensive export options (Excel, PDF, CSV, JSON)
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Export & Scheduling
Users can automate their reporting workflows with:
- Report scheduling with flexible frequency options (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Multiple notification channels (in-app, email, SMS) when reports are ready
- Various export format options
- Execution history tracking

### Notification System
The platform includes a comprehensive notification system:
- Real-time in-app notifications using SignalR
- Email notifications via SendGrid integration
- SMS notifications through Twilio integration
- Message prioritization and management

## Technical Innovations

### Performance Optimization
- Database indexing strategy for reporting queries
- Redis-based distributed caching
- Virtual scrolling for large data sets
- Efficient API design with pagination and filtering

### Security Implementation
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Data filtering based on user permissions
- Input validation and protection against common vulnerabilities
- Audit logging of user actions

### Deployment Strategy
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
- Multi-environment configuration management
- Monitoring and observability setup
